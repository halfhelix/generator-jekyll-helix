  <h1>Welcome to Jekyll-Helix</h1>
  <p>
    Jekell-Helix is a very opinionated Yeoman generator built with Jekyll and gulp.
    You will be able to quickly scaffold your site and start developing.
    As you are working on your site your assets will automatically be updated and
    injected into your browser as well as your posts. When you are done developing and want to
    publish it you are two commands away from having everything optimized and published.

    scss ~ autoprefixer ~ minification ~ browsersync ~ deployments ~ image optimization ~ gzip ~ much much more
